                    <p>
                        Arijit Singh was born on 25 April 1987[1] in Jiaganj, Murshidabad, West Bengal to Kakkar Singh, a Punjabi Sikh father[17] and Aditi Singh, a Bengali mother.[18] His paternal family came from Lahore during the Partition.[17] He began his music training at a very young age at home. His maternal aunt trained in Indian classical music, and his maternal grandmother used to sing. His maternal uncle played the tabla, and his mother also sang and played the tabla. He studied at Raja Bijay Singh High School and later at the Sripat Singh College, a University of Kalyani affiliate.[18] According to him he "was a decent student, but cared more about music" and his parents decided to train him professionally. He was taught Indian classical music by Rajendra Prasad Hazari and trained in tabla by Dhirendra Prasad Hazari. Birendra Prasad Hazari taught him Rabindra Sangeet (songs written and composed by Rabindranath Tagore) and pop music.[18] At the age of three, he started training under the Hazari brothers, and at the age of nine, he got a scholarship from the government for training in vocals in Indian classical music.

                        Singh began his career when he participated in the contemporary reality show, Fame Gurukul in 2005, but didn't receive widespread recognition before the release of "Tum Hi Ho" and "Chahun Main Ya Naa" in 2013.[11][12][13][14] He was declared the most-streamed Indian artist of 2020 and 2021 by Spotify. He was the most followed Asian soloist on Spotify.

                        Singh's musical career began when his guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari, who felt that "Indian classical music was a dying tradition", insisted him to leave his hometown and participate in the reality show Fame Gurukul (2005) at the age of 18.[19][21] He was eliminated by audience polling, finishing in sixth place.

                        Singh spent a part of his early musical career as a music programmer and music producer for music directors such as Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, Vishal–Shekhar, Mithoon, Monty Sharma and Pritam. While working with other composers he supervised the vocals, and the chorus sections, but it was while working with Pritam, that he began to produce and program music by himself.
